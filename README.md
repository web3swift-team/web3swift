## Installation

### Swift Package
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/ "") is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code that is well integrated with Swift build system.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `web3swift` as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.0.0"))
]
```

Or if your project is not a package follow these guidelines on [how to add a Swift Package to your Xcode project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app).


## Example usage
In the imports section:

```swift
import web3swift
import Web3Core
```

### CocoaPods

CocoaPods is not supported.

### Create Web3 Provider
Currently, web3swift supports only HTTP providers. WebSocket provider support was removed and is planned to be rebuilt from scratch.
To create a Web3HttpProvider you only need an RPC URL:
```swift
try await Web3HttpProvider(url: rpcUrl)
```

But if you know chain ID upfront it's better to specify one as well as with chain ID, the initializer won't have to ask the RPC for it and thus you guarantee that the initializer completes successfully without any asynchronous calls, considering your URL using `http/s` scheme:
```swift
let optionalChainId: Networks = .Custom(networkID: 42)
try await Web3HttpProvider(url: rpcUrl, network: optionalChainId)
```

Specify a keystore manager for the Web3HttpProvider if you want `web3.personal` namespace to work as it relies on use of the keystore:
```swift
try await Web3HttpProvider(url: rpcUrl, network: optionalChainId, keystoreManager: optionalKeystoreManager)
```

### Create Web3 Object
Creating a Web3 object is quite simple once you have a Web3 HTTP provider:
```swift
Web3(provider: provider)
```

Or if you are a user of Infura:
```swift
try await Web3.InfuraMainnetWeb3(accessToken: optionalInfuraToken)
try await Web3.InfuraGoerliWeb3(accessToken: optionalInfuraToken)
```

If you have a URL or you are using Infura you can use the following:
```swift
try await Web3.new(url, network: chainIdHere)
// or
let web3 = try await Web3.InfuraMainnetWeb3(accessToken: optionalInfuraToken)
let web3 = try await Web3.InfuraGoerliWeb3(accessToken: optionalGoerliToken)
```

### Send Ether
```swift
let transaction: CodableTransaction = .emptyTransaction
transaction.from = from ?? transaction.sender // `sender` one is if you have private key of your wallet address, so public key e.g. your wallet address could be interpreted
transaction.value = value
transaction.gasLimitPolicy = .manual(78423)
transaction.gasPricePolicy = .manual(20000000000)
web3.eth.send(transaction)
```

### Contract read method
```swift
let contract = web3.contract(Web3.Utils.erc20ABI, at: receipt.contractAddress!)!
let readOp = contract.createReadOperation("name")!
readOp.transaction.from = EthereumAddress("0xe22b8979739D724343bd002F9f432F5990879901")
let response = try await readTX.call()
```

### Write Transaction and call smart contract method
```swift
let abiString = "[]" // some ABI string
let bytecode = Data.fromHex("") // some ABI bite sequence
let contract = web3.contract(abiString, at: nil, abiVersion: 2)!
let parameters: [Any] = [...]
let deployOp = contract.prepareDeploy(bytecode: bytecode, constructor: contract.contract.constructor, parameters: parameters)!
deployOp.transaction.from = "" // your address
deployOp.transaction.gasLimitPolicy = .manual(3000000)
let result = try await deployTx.writeToChain(password: "web3swift")
```

### Sending network request to a node
```swift
func feeHistory(blockCount: UInt, block: BlockNumber, percentiles:[Double]) async throws -> Web3.Oracle.FeeHistory {
    let requestCall: APIRequest = .feeHistory(blockCount, block, percentiles)
    let response: APIResponse<Web3.Oracle.FeeHistory> = try await APIRequest.sendRequest(with: web3.provider, for: requestCall) /// explicitly declaring `Result` type is **required**.
    return response.result
}
```

## Build from source
### SPM
```bash
git clone https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift.git
cd web3swift
swift build
```

## Requirements

## Documentation
Documentation is under constructionüë∑üèªüë∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. We‚Äôre trying our best to comment on all public APIs as detailed as possible, but the end is still far to come. But in one of the nearest minor updates we‚Äôll bring DocC support of already done amount of docs. And your PR in such are more than welcome.

## Projects that are using web3swift
Please take a look at [Our customers](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift/wiki/Our-Customers) wiki page.

## Support

**[Join our discord](https://discord.gg/8bHCNmhS7x) and [Telegram](https://t.me/web3swift) if you need support or want to contribute to web3swift development!**

- If you **need help**, please take a look at our [FAQ](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift/wiki/FAQ "") or [open an issue](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift/issues).
- If you'd like to **see web3swift best practices**, check [Projects that using web3swift](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift/wiki/Our-Customers).
- If you **found a bug**, [open an issue](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift/issues).

## Development
To do local development and run the local tests, we recommend using [ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) which is also used by CI when running GitHub actions.

```cli
// To install
$ npm install ganache --global

// To run
$ ganache
```

This will create a local blockchain and also some test accounts that are used throughout our tests.
Make sure that `ganache` is running on its default port `8546`. To change the port in test cases locate `LocalTestCase.swift` and modify the static `url` variable.

### Before you commit

We are using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to run validations locally before a commit is created. Please, install pre-commit and run `pre-commit install` from the project's root directory. After that before every commit git hook will run and execute `codespell`, `swiftlint` and other checks.
